## ![Overview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Overview-📖-blue?style=for-the-badge)

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Threat Hunting and Vulnerability Assessment Dashboard**. This application provides real-time threat detection, vulnerability scanning, and log analysis, aimed at enhancing the security and resilience of IT infrastructures.


## Features ✨

### 🚨 **Threat Detection**
- **Upload Network Traffic Data**: Analyze network traffic data for anomalies using **Isolation Forest**.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically detect anomalies based on packet size and other metrics.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive visualizations to display detected anomalies in the network data.
- **Statistics**: Display anomaly counts and provide a detailed dataset for further analysis.

### 🔍 **Vulnerability Scanning**
- **Load Vulnerabilities**: Upload a JSON file containing vulnerability details.
- **Display Vulnerabilities**: View critical information like ID, summary, publish date, and severity of each vulnerability.

### 📋 **Log Analysis**
- **Log File Upload**: Upload log files (TXT/CSV) for analysis.
- **Basic Log Analysis**: Check for failed login attempts and provide a quick summary.
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Visualize the most frequent terms in the logs with a word cloud.
- **Generate Log Data**: Create an advanced log data CSV file for testing and further analysis.

## Example JSON Structure for Vulnerabilities
   - Here’s an example of the expected structure for the vulnerabilities.json file:

        ```bash
        [
          {
            "id": "CVE-2021-1234",
            "summary": "Critical vulnerability in the authentication system",
            "published_date": "2021-12-01",
            "severity": "High"
          },
          {
            "id": "CVE-2022-5678",
            "summary": "Buffer overflow vulnerability in network service",
            "published_date": "2022-01-15",
            "severity": "Medium"
          }
      ]
